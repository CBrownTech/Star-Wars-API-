# Star Wars Website
Welcome to my Star Wars website! This website is designed to provide information about the Star Wars universe, including details about the films and characters featured in the movies. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and the Star Wars API.

## Pages
The website includes the following webpages:

- Homepage: This page serves as the main landing page for the website, providing an overview of the Star Wars universe and links to the films and characters lists.
- Films List: This page lists all of the Star Wars films, along with their release dates and summaries.
- Characters List: This page lists all of the major characters from the Star Wars movies, along with their descriptions.
- Films Profile: This page provides detailed information about a specific Star Wars film, including its director, producer, cast, and plot summary. The information on this page is extracted from the Star Wars API.
- Characters Profile: This page provides detailed information about a specific Star Wars character, including their name, birth year, gender, and description. The information on this page is also extracted from the Star Wars API.

## Styling
Each page on the website is styled using CSS files, which add some design and formatting to the content. The CSS files are located in the "styles" folder and include:

- cl_style.css: This file contains the main styling for the website, including font choices, color schemes, and layout.
- homepage.css: This file contains additional styling for the homepage, including a background image and text formatting.

## Installation and Usage

To run the Star Wars website on your local machine, simply download the files, run the code, and open the "homepage.html" file in your web browser. From there, you will see two options: "Characters" and "Films". The website is designed to be responsive and should display correctly on desktop and mobile devices.
